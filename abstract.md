## Asprirational Abstract

For this class, I would like to work on water body extraction (WBE) using deep learning based methods. Observing surface water bodies is done using remote sensing data. It is important for ecological and climate studies and can be applied for flood hazard prediction, water planning in urban areas. Traditionally, water body extraction relies on methods such as water body index methods, spectral relation, threshold segmentation etc. For my project, I plan to use deep learning methods such as CNN, FCN, SegNet and the more recently proposed Deep UNet for identifying water bodies. The motivation to use deep neural networks is to improve the WBE predictions in more challenging settings such as urban areas, where the scope of misclassifying the image features is more. Based on the preliminary results of the above models and further, in-depth reading, I plan to explore alternative methods/tweaks to the current architectures to achieve better system performance. I plan to focus on the So2SAT dataset as a major dataset. I also would like to explore images from GaoFen-2 and WorldView-2.
